// Javascript variables can be declared in 4 ways:

x = 5; // automatically
var x = 5; // using var
let x = 5; // using let
const x = 5; // using const

// identifiers
/* The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

    Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
    Names must begin with a letter.
    Names can also begin with $ and _ .
    Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
    Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
